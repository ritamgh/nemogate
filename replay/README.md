# replay: the runner, the filesystem diff and the budget check

Owner: A. Pipeline code: the generality rule (AGENTS.md rule 5) applies to everything here
outside `tests/`. Nothing in replay/ names a task, a constraint, the seed repo or `refapp`
except the one default noted under "Defaults".

This file is the contract between the modules below. Change it only together with the code.

Week 1 scope (docs/SPEC.md, "Minimal runner for the Oct 12 kill gate"): one run = write the run
config, launch the app with the gate's middleware, call `evaluate()`, write the run record with
its reproducibility fields. Forks at boundaries, per-boundary images and statistics are week 2.

## Layout

```
replay/
  app.py        App and AppTask Protocols, and pairs(arms, operators) (committed with this file)
  fsdiff.py     snapshot an image's repo, diff two snapshots
  record.py     run ids, run config, scoped ledger, reproducibility fields, run folder files
  runner.py     Runner (one run, many runs) and run(), the cross-owner function
  budget.py     N per arm from a bucket and a cost per run; `python -m replay.budget`
refapp/app.py   the reference app's App (owned by refapp, listed here because the runner uses it)
```

## fsdiff.py

```python
SKIP_DIRS = frozenset({"__pycache__", ".pytest_cache"})   # generic Python caches only
SKIP_SUFFIXES = frozenset({".pyc"})
async def snapshot(client, image_uuid: str, root: str, *, timeout: int = 120) -> dict[str, str]
    # repo-relative POSIX path -> "sha256:<hex>" for every regular file under `root` in the image,
    # "symlink:<target>" for a symlink (never followed). Skips SKIP_DIRS and SKIP_SUFFIXES.
    # Runs ONE command, disposable, on a plain image: `image = await client.images.use(UUID(uuid))`
    # then `await image.run(shell=..., disposable=True, timeout=timeout)` (never on a session:
    # FACTS §3). The command is `python3 -c <script>` that prints one JSON object on stdout
    # (handles any file name: spaces, newlines, unicode). Raises RuntimeError on a non-zero
    # exit, truncated output (`result.result.truncated` or equivalent) or unparsable JSON.
def diff(base: dict[str, str], final: dict[str, str]) -> list[FsChange]
    # added (only in final), deleted (only in base), modified (both, different value).
    # Sorted by path. Unchanged paths are absent.
```

## record.py

```python
ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]   # the checkout this code runs from
def new_run_id() -> str                      # "r-<UTC %Y%m%dT%H%M%S>-<6 lowercase hex>"
def git_sha(ref: str, repo_dir: Path = ROOT) -> str
    # full 40-hex commit sha of `git rev-parse --verify <ref>^{commit}`; ValueError if unknown
def require_checkout_at(ref: str, repo_dir: Path = ROOT, *, allow_dirty: bool = False) -> str
    # The code that runs is this checkout, so a run may only claim repo_sha = HEAD.
    # ValueError if git_sha(ref) != git_sha("HEAD") (re-running another ref is week 2), or if
    # tracked files differ from HEAD (`git status --porcelain --untracked-files=no` non-empty)
    # and not allow_dirty. Returns the sha.
def lockfile_hash(path: Path = ROOT / "uv.lock") -> str      # first 12 hex of sha256(bytes)
def model_ids(config: AppConfig) -> dict[Role, str]           # every role's configured id
def scoped_ledger(ledger: Ledger, constraint_id: str) -> Ledger   # only that entry; KeyError
def ledger_hash(ledger: Ledger) -> str
    # first 12 hex of sha256 over compact sorted-key JSON of ledger.model_dump(mode="json").
    # The default until B's loader returns its own (SPEC: "returned by B's loader").
def write_ledger(ledger: Ledger, path: Path) -> None   # YAML that schemas.ledger.load_ledger_yaml
                                                       # reads back to an equal Ledger
def make_run_config(*, run_id, task: AppTask, arm, operator, run_dir: Path, ledger_path: Path,
                    seed: int, repo_ref: str) -> RunConfig
    # target_boundary/target_constraint from the task; trace_path = run_dir/"trace.jsonl";
    # paths are stored as given (str).
def write_json(path: Path, model: BaseModel | list[BaseModel]) -> None
    # pretty JSON (indent 2, trailing newline) of model_dump(mode="json"), parents created
```

## runner.py

```python
class Runner:
    def __init__(self, *, app: App, evaluate: EvaluateFn, make_middleware: MakeMiddlewareFn,
                 ledger: Ledger, config: AppConfig, runs_dir: Path,
                 client_factory=<Contree>, backend_factory=<ContreeSandbox>,
                 ledger_hash_fn=record.ledger_hash, recursion_limit: int = 60,
                 allow_dirty: bool = False, repo_dir: Path = ROOT)
    async def run_one(self, task: AppTask, arm: Arm, operator: Operator, *, seed: int,
                      repo_ref: str = "main") -> RunRecord
    async def arun(self, task_ids, arms, operators, n, repo_ref="main") -> list[RunRecord]
    def run(self, task_ids, arms, operators, n, repo_ref="main") -> list[RunRecord]  # asyncio.run

def run(task_ids, arms, operators, n, repo_ref="main") -> list[RunRecord]
    # schemas.contracts.RunFn. Builds the default Runner (see Defaults) and calls .run.
```

`run_one`, in order (each step's output goes into `runs_dir/<run_id>/`):

1. `repo_sha = record.require_checkout_at(repo_ref, ...)`; `run_id = new_run_id()`;
   `run_dir = runs_dir / run_id`.
2. Scoped ledger: `scoped_ledger(self.ledger, task.constraint)` written to `run_dir/ledger.yaml`.
   `ledger_hash = ledger_hash_fn(self.ledger)` (the FULL ledger: runs on different target
   constraints stay comparable). Run config written to `run_dir/run_config.json`.
3. `client = client_factory()`; `base = await app.base_image(client)`;
   `session = (await client.images.use(UUID(base))).session()`; `backend = backend_factory(session)`.
4. `mw = make_middleware(run_config)`; graph = `app.build(backend, middleware=mw,
   subagent_middleware=mw, checkpointer=saver)` with `saver` an `AsyncSqliteSaver` on
   `run_dir/checkpoints.sqlite` (closed after the run). The SAME list goes to both slots: the
   gate tells planner from subagents by `lc_agent_name` (refapp/README.md, "Paths and agent
   names"). Every model call happens inside `common.spend.run_scope(run_id)`.
5. `await graph.ainvoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": task.user_message}]},
   config={"configurable": {"thread_id": run_id}, "recursion_limit": recursion_limit})`.
   `checkpoint_id = (await graph.aget_state(same config)).config["configurable"]["checkpoint_id"]`.
6. `final = str(session.uuid)`; `fs_diff = diff(await snapshot(client, base, app.repo_root),
   await snapshot(client, final, app.repo_root))` -> `run_dir/fs_diff.json`.
7. `task_success, tail = await app.task_success(session, task)`; a failing tail goes to
   `run_dir/task_check.txt`.
8. `trace = parse_trace_jsonl(Path(run_config.trace_path).read_text())`. A missing trace file
   is an error (RuntimeError naming the path): no trace means the gate did not run, and
   evaluating an empty trace would report zero violations.
9. `violations = evaluate(scoped, trace, fs_diff)`; `RunRecord.violations` = the unique
   constraint ids in first-seen order. Full list -> `run_dir/violations.json`.
10. `tokens, cost = common.spend.run_totals(run_id)`; every Role present (0 if unused).
11. `RunRecord(... contree_image=final, checkpoint_id=..., model_ids=record.model_ids(config),
    safe_config_hash=config.safe_config.hash, ledger_hash, repo_sha, lockfile_hash)` ->
    `run_dir/record.json`; return it.

If the agent run raises (step 5), write the traceback to `run_dir/error.txt` and re-raise: a
crashed run has no record. `arun` runs sequentially (no concurrency in week 1), tasks in the
order of `task_ids` (KeyError on an unknown id), then pairs, then `n` repetitions with
`seed = <repetition index>`; it stops at the first exception.

## budget.py

```python
SHARES = {"dev": 0.20, "kill_gate": 0.10, "main_sweep": 0.40, "repair": 0.15, "final": 0.15}
    # docs/SPEC.md "Budget"; amount = share * config.budget.total_usd (per person)
def runs_per_cell(bucket_usd: float, cost_per_run: float, n_pairs: int, n_tasks: int) -> int
    # floor(bucket / (cost_per_run * n_pairs * n_tasks)); ValueError unless all inputs > 0
def plan(*, bucket: str, cost_per_run: float, arms, operators, n_tasks: int, config: AppConfig,
         spent_usd: float) -> Plan
    # Plan(bucket, bucket_usd, cost_per_run, pairs, n_tasks, n, planned_usd, spent_usd,
    #      stop_usd, capped): n from runs_per_cell with n_pairs = len(app.pairs(...));
    # stop_usd = stop_at_fraction * total_usd; if spent + planned would pass stop_usd, n is
    # lowered to the largest value that fits and capped=True.
def mean_cost(records: Iterable[RunRecord]) -> float     # ValueError on none
main(): `python -m replay.budget --bucket kill_gate --arms natural mutated --operators none drop
        --tasks <id> <id> (--cost-per-run X | --from-runs runs/)` prints the plan, one fact per
        line, ending with `N per arm per task: <n>`. Exit 1 when n < 1. spent_usd from
        common.spend.total_spent(). No model calls, no Contree.
```

## Defaults

`replay.runner.run()` (and the CLI, if any) builds: `app = refapp.app.APP` (the one place
replay names the reference app), `evaluate = oracle.evaluate`, `make_middleware =
gate.make_middleware`, `ledger = load_ledger_yaml(ROOT/"nemogate.yaml")`. All imported inside
the function, so replay imports and tests work before B's packages exist; a missing one raises
a RuntimeError saying which package is missing.
